# Understanding Project Management in NodeJS

---

## a. Package Managers

### What is a package manager?
A **package manager** is a tool that helps developers install, update, remove, and manage external libraries (called packages) that are required for a project. These packages provide ready-made functionality instead of writing everything from scratch.

**Example:**  
Using a package like `express` to create a server instead of writing raw Node.js code.

---

### Why do we need package managers in backend development?
Package managers are important because they:
- Save development time
- Manage project dependencies automatically
- Maintain consistent package versions
- Make teamwork and collaboration easier
- Help in updating and securing libraries

---

### Problems faced if package managers are not used
Without package managers:
- Libraries must be added manually
- Version conflicts occur between systems
- Updating libraries becomes difficult
- Higher risk of bugs and security issues
- Project structure becomes messy

---

## b. NPM (Node Package Manager)

### What is NPM?
**NPM (Node Package Manager)** is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install, manage, and share JavaScript packages.

NPM is automatically installed when Node.js is installed.

---

### Why is NPM important for Node.js applications?
NPM is important because it:
- Provides access to thousands of open-source packages
- Handles dependency installation automatically
- Makes backend development faster and easier
- Keeps projects consistent across environments

---

### How NPM helps in managing dependencies
NPM:
- Stores dependency details in `package.json`
- Downloads required packages into `node_modules`
- Locks exact versions using `package-lock.json`
- Ensures the same setup for all developers

**Example:**
```bash
npm install express
```

## c. Backend Project Initialization

### Command to initialize a Node.js backend project
```bash
npm init
```

---

### Explanation of `npm init` and `npm init -y`

#### npm init
- Interactive command
- Asks project details (name, version, author, etc.)
- Creates `package.json` based on user input

#### npm init -y
- Skips all questions
- Generates `package.json` with default values
- Faster and commonly used

---

## d. Files and Folders Created After Project Initialization

### package.json
- Main configuration file
- Contains project details, scripts, and dependencies
- Required to run and share the project

---

### node_modules
- Contains all installed dependencies
- Auto-generated by NPM
- Very large in size

---

### package-lock.json
- Stores exact dependency versions
- Ensures consistency across systems
- Prevents version mismatch issues

---

## GitHub Commit Rules

### Files/Folders NOT to push to GitHub
- `node_modules/`
  - Large in size
  - Can be regenerated using `npm install`

---

### Files that MUST be committed
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- Project source files (e.g., `index.js`)

**Reason:**  
These files allow others to install dependencies and run the project correctly.
